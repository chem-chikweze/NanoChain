Using Blockchain as an alternative to Centralized fun
Hi I'm Kem, a blockchain developer and engineer.  We are going to have a lot of fun working on this project.
This project is an experiment to track the use of of decentralized ledgers, a means of keeping records between multiple parties in a contract.
The ledger will be held by everyone of them, as a process (transaction) takes place, it will be recorded in sync with the individual ledgers. For each,stage in the transaction or each completed stage or transaction to be chained to the blockchain, most to all of the participants need to agree.
Participants can decide on how many more of the percentage of users that will be accepted to be an agreement. That is if an entity in a contract doesn't have a lot of trust,which is the case in most contracts, the user the user can opt that, he has to take part in the decision or agreement door through for each block that is added to the ledger.

The next thing we will discuss are the types of transactions that will be done on the blockchain...will they be definite or will there be room for inclusion of other different types of transactions?
